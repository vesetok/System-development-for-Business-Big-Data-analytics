## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Masterâ€™s thesis, focusing on the **design and implementation of a Business Big Data Analytics System**.  
The goal is to create a functional data analysis framework that supports **data-driven decision-making** using modern tools and technologies for business intelligence.

---

## Objectives
- Develop a Python-based analytics solution for **Big Data in business environments**.  
- Design an **automated data processing pipeline** for sales and profitability analytics.  
- Integrate visualization tools such as **Matplotlib** and **PowerPivot** for the generation of interactive dashboards.  
- Provide a set of **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for management insights.  
- Demonstrate the value of **data visualization and predictive analytics** in strategic business decisions.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Python 3.12**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**  
- **PowerPivot / Power BI**  
- **Excel (.xlsx) datasets**  
- **Jupyter / PyCharm IDE**

## Features
- Data import, cleaning, and preprocessing  
- Profitability and revenue analysis by product and region  
- Visualization dashboards and KPI reports  
- Predictive trend analysis using regression models  
- Automated reporting module

## Process Flow
- Data source (Global superstore) - import, cleaning, and preprocessing (Feature engineering - Expenses, Margin %)
- KPI computations (Sales, Profit, Orders, Customers, Expenses)
- Descriptive analytics (Regions, Categories, Products, Customers)
- Visualization & Interactive analytics (Python/Plotly, Matplotlib & Seaborn, Power Pivot)
- Forecasting models (Time series, Regression)
- Evaluation and Export (Excel/CSV results)
- Power Pivot - Final interactive dashboards
